            Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and
            filmed
            in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified,
            and
            dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung
            cancer.
            White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce
            and
            distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the
            dangers
            of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting
            of
            five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.

            Rick Astley, who had only returned to performing after a 10-year hiatus, was initially hesitant about using
            his
            newfound popularity from the meme to further his career but accepted the fame by Rickrolling the 2008 Macy's
            Thanksgiving Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Rick Astley has seen his
            performance career revitalized by the meme's popularity.
