        <p>《正義迴廊》改編自2013年一宗轟動全港的「逆子弒親案」，張顯宗(楊偉倫 飾)聯同友人唐文奇(麥沛東 飾)於寓所內殺害父母，並進行肢解。案件進入法庭審訊程序，二人皆否認謀殺罪名，兩位資深大律師吳冠峰(林海峰 飾)和游嘉莉(蘇玉華 飾)分別代表二人上庭辯護，檢控官朱愛倫(周文健 飾)卻質疑二人早已部署殺人計劃，為財謀命似是毋庸置疑。然而在攻守互換後，吳和游兩位大律師施展各自辯才，揭露出案情中更為撲朔迷離之處，而唐文奇出庭自辯時更把一切指控推得一乾二淨。在一幕幕激烈的法庭辯論下，兩位被告上演出「天才」與「白痴」的戲碼，真相似乎越辯越模糊。九位不同背景的陪審員在休息室展開話語權的角力，同時陷入對與錯的正義思辯中。</p>
        <p> Adapted from a sensational 2013 family murder, Henry Cheung partnered up with his friend Angus Tong to murder and dismember his parents. In the courtroom, two veteran lawyers Wilson Ng and Carrie Yau were defending the pair pleading not guilty. The prosecutor Allen Chu suggests the murder was a calculated move for money. But the plot thickened when Ng and Yau began to present their case, and when Tong rebutted all accusations on his own. The truth becomes all the more elusive as the defendants played the role of ‘genius’ and ‘idiot’ in court. In the breakroom, discussions between the nine jury members spiraled into debates of right and wrong.</p>
